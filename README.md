# GCode-Terminal

# Motivation
I am in the long of building and improving my own cnc machine. My cnc is driven by a raspberry pi, which is configured to be headless. I couldn't find any open source software which allowed me to run gcode files from the terminal. So I thought I would add to the scope of my already big project and create a program which can send / run gcode from the terminal.

# How to Test
run "make test" in the root directory.

# How to use
todo: create and link to wiki pages.
appsettings.json has the port configuration.
"make run" to start it off
arrow keys to jog the machine
'+' and '-' change the scale of how far the machines travels per jog.
